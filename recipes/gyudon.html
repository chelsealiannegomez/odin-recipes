    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry sake</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 pound thinly shaved beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine onion, dashi, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a medium saucepan or saucier and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add beef and cook, stirring until beef is cooked through and liquid has reduced down to an intensely flavored broth, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger and simmer for 1 minute longer. Adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Divide rice between 2 to 3 bowls and top with beef and sauce mixture. Garnish each bowl with a poached egg (if using), sliced scallions, beni-shoga, and togarashi. Serve immediately.
